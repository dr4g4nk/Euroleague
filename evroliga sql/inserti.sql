The club had a slow start in the competition with just two wins from its first nine games. Zvezda signed head coach Dragan Sakota midseason to replace Milan Tomic (and interim coach Andrija Gavrilovic) and added Kevin Punter and Vladimir Stimac. Lorenzo Brown found his rhythm, too, and Zvezda went on to win seven of its next nine EuroLeague games, including victories in Kaunas, Milan, St Petersburg and Villeurbanne. That brought Zvezda\'s record to 9-9 record, but the team only won two of its next 10 games and ranked 14th with an 11-17 record when the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that moment, Zvezda ranked third in the Adriatic League with a 14-7 record and had suffered a heartbreaking 84-85 overtime loss against archrival Partizan NIS Belgrade in the Serbian Radivoj Korac Cup final.

Last season, Aito\'s second with the team, ALBA roared to a 5-1 start to the regular season with high scoring averages. The Berliners had to deal with important injuries that affected the core of the roster, but a 7-3 mark at the end of the regular season allowed them to place second in Group B. In the Top 16, ALBA dominated again and won Group E, paving the way to bigger things, including an MVP of the season award for Luke Sikma and a Coach of the Year accolade for Aito. ALBA disposed of Unicaja Malaga in quarterfinals 2-1 and then swept the semis against MoraBanc Andorra to set up a repeat from its first EuroCup Finals in 2010: Valencia Basket. ALBA fought, but only managed to win its game at home after a thrilling overtime and Valencia claimed its fourth EuroCup title in Spain. That did not change the fact that ALBA had had a magical run in the competition. In the German League, ALBA landed third in the regular season at 27-7 and in the playoffs, the team plowed through the quarterfinals and semifinals with respective sweeps to face archrival FC Bayern Munich in the decisive round and earn its EuroLeague ticket for 2019-20. Bayern swept the series, but ALBA lost all the games by 5 or fewer points, making it clear that it remains a major contender in Germany.

Mike James, Darrun Hilliard and Johannes Voigtmann arrived to play big roles, but one of its pillars, 2019 Final Four MVP Will Clyburn, was lost for the season due to a torn ACL suffered in Round 4. Even so, James led CSKA to a solid start with victories in five of its first six Turkish Airlines EuroLeague games. CSKA soon added Howard Sant-Roos to replace Clyburn and struggled more than in previous seasons with five rare home losses. Nevertheless, CSKA managed to clinch a playoff spot before the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that point, CSKA ranked fourth with a 19-9 record, the same as Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv. CSKA was second in the VTB League with a 15-4 record when that competition was canceled, too. The club has already landed Nikola Milutinov and extended James\'s deal, setting the basis for a new core of players that should lead CSKA to its usual standards - competing for every trophy and every game.',5,'..\\..\\Images\\Clubs Images\\cska.png','+7 495 225 2662','cskabasket.com','@cskabasket','@cskabasket','cskabasket','www.youtube.com/channel/UCvW3rUz6sTtFGw7wkwQnL4Q'),(9,'FC Barcelona',20,'FC Barcelona took a major step towards a return to its old standards in the 2018-19 season as it challenged for every title available. The club brought in experienced players like Kevin Pangos, Chris Singleton and Kyle Kuric and Barcelona enjoyed a good start in the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague by winning five of its first seven games. Barcelona bounced back after a four-game losing streak to win nine of its next 11 and qualify to the playoffs in advance. Barca finished the regular season in fifth place with an 18-12 record. It was Barcelona\'s first playoff appearance under the new format. Coach Svetislav Pesic\'s men stole home-court advantage from Anadolu Efes Istanbul, but then lost in Game 3 at home and Game 5 in Turkey, thus missing its chance to reach the Final Four for the first time since 2014. Barcelona was competitive in domestic action; it won the Spanish Copa del Rey by downing Real Madrid 94-93 in overtime with Thomas Heurtel earning MVP honors. Real took revenge in the Spanish League finals. Still, Barcelona managed to add new titles and raise its competitive level in a 2018-19 season that could be a turning point for the EuroLeague power.',6,'..\\..\\Images\\Clubs Images\\fcbarcelona.png','+34 93 496 3714','www.fcbarcelona.com/en/basketball/','@fcbbasket','@fcbbasket','FCBbasket','www.youtube.com/channel/UC14UlmYlSNiQCBe9Eookf_A'),(15,'Khimki Moscow Region',4,'Khimki Moscow Region is set to start its fourth consecutive Turkish Airlines Euroleague campaign fully established as a powerhouse able to beat anyone, anywhere. Last season, Khimki returned Janis Timma, Anthony Gill and superstar guard Alexey Shved and surrounded them with talented players such as Devin Booker, Jonas Jerebko and Stefan Jovic. Khimki had a strong start to the EuroLeague regular season with victories in six of its first eight games. Khimki, however, went on to win just three of the next 13 games, which damaged its playoff chances. The club regained momentum again, winning four of its last five games before the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, Khimki ranked seventh with a 13-15 record and led the VTB League standings at 18-1 before that competition was canceled without a winner, too. Khimki looks to return even stronger, with the right combination of talent and experience, to make more noise than ever.
